            <p id="para1">I am not sure if you will ever visit this page again, but if you do, I want you to know how much you mean to me. I couldnâ€™t bear to keep your picture online for long, as your safety is important to me. Just know that whenever you want to see the entire website up and running again, I would be more than happy to make that happen.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m leaving a part of my birthday wish here as a little reminder of how special you are to me. You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, and I hope you always carry this message in your heart. If you ever need a smile or a reason to remember how amazing you are, I hope you come back to read this.</p>
            <p>And no matter where life takes us, I will keep this website up, just for you. Even if I am not a part of your life in the years to come, I want you to know that I will always celebrate you from afar. Your happiness means the world to me, and I hope this little corner of the internet reminds you of the beautiful impact you have had on my life.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <p id="para2">As always I am short of words when it comes to describe how much of a beautiful soul you are. But still I will give it a try ðŸ«£</p>
            <p>For all the time I have known you, for every moment we shared, every glance we exchanged and all the laughs echoing in my memory, I cannot be more thankful to God for sending a person like you into my life.</p>
            <p>And of course, tumari smile, jab bhi tum smile krti ho, itâ€™s enough for someone to forget their bad day and be happy, just like sunlight.</p>
            <p>What truly impresses me about you has always been your confidence, the way you carry yourself with such grace, that it's hard not to admire you.</p>
            <p>Our first meeting on that memorable journey when we met on the train was like a stroke of magicâ€”an unexpected encounter that blossomed into something beautiful. That trip filled me with the colors of your joy, and now every journey feels incomplete without you.</p>
            <p>I want you to know you are incredibly capable; I have no doubt you will achieve great things, and one day, you will be running your own successful empire.</p>
            <p>As you celebrate another year of life, I hope you embrace all that you are. Dream big, chase your passion, and remember that you are never alone in your journey. Iâ€™ll be here, cheering you on every step of the way, ready to celebrate your victories and lift you during challenges (and probably crack a few bad jokes along the way to keep you smiling ðŸ˜‰).</p>
            <p>On this special day, I hope you feel all the love and joy that you bring to others. You are a blessing to those lucky enough to know you, and I am grateful every day for the moments we share. May this birthday be filled with laughter, love, and all the beautiful things you deserve.</p>
            <p>Hereâ€™s to you, the best of all! Happy Birthday MuskanðŸ’—</p>
